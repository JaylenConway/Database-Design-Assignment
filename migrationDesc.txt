1. Update the users table to include an account_type column that stores the user's account type
    (e.g., "free", "standard", "premium").
2. Create a new table called playlists that stores information about playlists. 
    The playlists table would need to have a primary key (id), a foreign key to the users 
    table (user_id), and a name (name) column to store the name of the playlist.
3. Create a new table called playlist_songs that stores information about the songs in each 
    playlist. The playlist_songs table would need to have a primary key (id), a foreign key to the 
    playlists table (playlist_id), a foreign key to the songs table (song_id), and an order column to store the order/rank of each song in the playlist.
